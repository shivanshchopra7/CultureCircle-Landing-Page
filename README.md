1. Planning and Strategy:
Technology Selection:

I chose Next.js for the web because it has built-in server-side rendering and works well with React components. It also integrates easily with Tailwind CSS, which is great for quick styling.

Tailwind CSS helps with responsiveness and scalability, making it easier to manage layout, spacing, and typography.

Component Architecture & Data Flow:

I broke down the page into smaller, reusable components for both web and mobile.

Next.js will fetch product details using static site generation (SSG) or server-side rendering (SSR).

Challenges:

A key challenge is ensuring the design is pixel-perfect across both web and mobile due to different screen sizes and densities.

2. Design Decisions:
UI/UX Design:

I made design decisions to match the provided Figma file, focusing on clean typography, well-organized sections, and intuitive navigation.

For the web version, I used Flexbox and Grid systems in Tailwind to make the layout responsive.

Responsive Design & Accessibility:

I used Tailwind's responsive utilities (sm:, md:, lg:) throughout the code to ensure the layout adapts to different screen sizes.

State Management and API Integration:

For the web, I used React state to manage product-related details (like selected variants and reviews).

3. Implementation Details:
Error Handling and Edge Cases:

I included fallback UI (e.g., loading spinners or error messages) for cases when the product data fails to load.

For edge cases (e.g., missing images or unavailable variants), I displayed placeholders or messages.

Performance Optimizations:

For the web version, I used Next.js's next/image for automatic image resizing and lazy loading to improve performance.

4. Deployment and Hosting:
Challenges During Deployment:

The main challenge was ensuring both the web and mobile versions were deployed with the correct configurations (environment variables and settings).

The web version was deployed on Vercel (Next.js), while the mobile app went to Google Play and Apple App Store, requiring attention to store-specific guidelines.

Environment Variable Management and CI/CD Setup:

I used Vercel’s environment configuration for the web and Flutter’s .env package for mobile to manage environment variables securely.

Hosting Platforms and Database Integration:

The web version was hosted on Vercel, while the mobile app was deployed to app stores. For the backend, I used Node.js/Express to fetch product data from a database (e.g., PostgreSQL or MongoDB).

Main Approach:
I focused on clean design principles, taking inspiration from the Culture Circle website. I emphasized whitespace, typography, and the proper use of elements. I used Tailwind’s media queries throughout the code to ensure responsiveness. I started by analyzing the layout and breaking it down into components to ensure a well-structured and organized implementation.
